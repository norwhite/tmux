TODO AM Remove this before merging to master!

Plan of action for the vistar issue.

In key_bindings.c add new bindings for * and # which executes:
send -X send -X search-forward-selection
send -X send -X search-backward-selection

In search-forward-selection (use window_copy_cmd_search_again as template):

get the word under the cursor:
call window_copy_cmd_select_word
next call window_copy_get_selection
set searchstr
next clean up by calling window_copy_clear_selection as in window_copy_cmd_copy_selection
might need to return a redraw enum value

use it to set wme->data->searchstr (free existing)
then run the regular search function window_copy_search
